# DependencyCop

This repository contains an implementation of a number of Roslyn analyzer rules using the .NET Compiler Platform. The rules enforce certain restrictions on dependencies between code in different namespaces.

For an overview of the rules, see [README](./Liversen.DependencyCop/README.md).
