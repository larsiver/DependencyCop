## Cause

A piece of code refers code in a descendant namespace.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a type from a descendant namespace is referred.

This rule is adopted from Microsofts [Namespace Naming Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-1.1/893ke618(v=vs.71)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) that states:

> A nested namespace should have a dependency on types in the containing namespace. For example, the classes in the System.Web.UI.Design depend on the classes in System.Web.UI. However, the classes in System.Web.UI do not depend on the classes in System.Web.UI.Design.

A typical violation of this rule is when an entry point function like the C# Main method for a console application is placed in the root namespace of the application. In this case the recommended approach is to move the Main method to a sub-namespace called `Main`.

## How to fix violations

Restructure the code.
