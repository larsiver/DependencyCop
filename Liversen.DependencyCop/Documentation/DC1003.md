## Cause

A piece of code takes part in a namespace reference cycle.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when code within an assembly forms a cycle between the containing namespaces.

As an example, if code in namespace `SomeCompany.Transaction.Reconciliation` refers code in namespace `SomeCompany.Account.Synchronization`, then this dependency will be recorded as a dependency from `SomeCompany.Transaction` to `SomeCompany.Account` with the consequence that nothing in namespace `SomeCompany.Account` (including sub-namespaces) is allowed to reference code in namespace `SomeCompany.Transaction` (including sub-namespaces).


## How to fix violations

Restructure the code.
